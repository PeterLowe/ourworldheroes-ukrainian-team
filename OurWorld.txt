Greenland is home to the largest National Park in the world
1. Greenland is the largest island in the world that is not a continent
Greenland
The size of Western Europe, or one third the size of Australia or the main part of the USA – Greenland is BIG! It is the 12th largest country in the world, so keep that in mind when you are planning your itinerary.
2. Greenland has the lowest population density of any country in the world.
Although it is big, it only has a population of 56,000 people. That means you’ll run into 0.03 people per square kilometer. Of course, the population is not distributed evenly and nobody lives in the vast majority of the country, but even then – there is plenty of room to be alone – even in the capital city.
3. Greenland is home to the largest National Park in the world

The entire north-east of Greenland is one massive national park. Established in 1974 and expanded to its current size in 1988, it is a sanctuary for arctic wildlife as special permission must be obtained from the Greenlandic Government for access.
4 . 80% of Greenland is covered in ice
Greenland
One of the most amazing Greenland facts is that Greenland’s “inland ice” is the second-largest ice sheet in the world (behind Antarctica). It is an incredible sight as you fly over the country and reaches up to 3,500m thick in some places.
5. Greenland is fascinating for geologists
There is something special about the rocks of Greenland. Even for non-professionals, the patterns found in them and the sheen they give off is not like anywhere else in the world.
They are beautiful. And some of them very valuable – with Greenland harbouring plenty of rare mineral and gemstone deposits.
6. Greenland only has one town that is not on the coast
Kangerlussuaq
Since it is only the fringes of Greenland that emerge from under the snow during Summer, all of the towns and settlements in Greenland are located on the coast. The exception is Kangerlussuaq, whose name means “big fjord”.
No surprise to discover that it lies about 160km away from the main coastline at the end of a very long fjord. Due to its “inland” location, it has some of the coldest weather in the country, and it is one of the endpoints of the famous long-distance hiking trail: The Arctic Circle Trail.
7. Greenland got its name as a promotional stunt
If Greenland is covered in ice, why is it called Greenland? Turns out, the exiled Viking – Eric the Red – came up with the name as a marketing ploy to encourage others to follow him to Greenland and establish new settlements there.
That being said, South Greenland (where Erik the Red settled) is actually remarkably green during Summer.
8. The Inuit name for Greenland – Inuit Nunaat – means “land of the people”
Inuit
Although we all know the country as Greenland, the original peoples called their land “Inuit Nunaat”. Nowadays, Greenlanders have adopted the name “Kalaallit Nunaat”, which means “country of the Greenlanders”.
9. Greenland has the most northerly capital city in the world – Nuuk
Nuuk
Nuuk and Reykjavik vie for the title of most northerly capital city, but Nuuk beats out the Icelandic capital by just a few kilometres. We do admit, however, that because Greenland is still a part of the Realm of Denmark, Reykjavik is the northernmost capital for a sovereign country.
10. You can only get to Greenland from Denmark or Iceland
Even though Greenland is geographically part of the North American continent, you can’t fly direct (at the moment). You must first get yourself to Copenhagen or Reykjavik in order to access the country.
